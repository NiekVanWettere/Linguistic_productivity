# Linguistic productivity analysis in R

This tutorial provides an overview of different plotting techniques and statistical methods that can be used to perform a productivity analysis of linguistic constructions. First, it is shown how a dataset comprised of individual attestations (= rows) and variables (= columns) can give rise to different types of plots and ananlyses. In part 2, a dataset containing productivity measurements (= columns) per construction (= rows) is used as a starting point for further statistical analysis.
